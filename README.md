Metacrafters solana course module 2 challenge 3
**Phantom Wallet Challenge**
Your challenge is: **add a button to disconnect from the Phantom Wallet.**

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Complete the previous lessons and create a “Connect” button for Phantom Wallet connection.

2. Once you are connected, you should be able to see an address on the screen - which is the address of the current connected account.

3. Add a Disconnect button functionality - a button on the top right side of the screen.

4. Upon clicking this button, you should be disconnected from the current Phantom wallet instance and the “Connect” button should re-appear.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
